In this paper, we investigated the private coded caching scenario, where the aim is to preserve the demand privacy for all the users in the system. Specifically, our aim was to extend the 
privacy garauntee to a multi-delivery scenario, in which there are multi rounds of delivery for multi rounds of demand vectors with a single cache phase in the beginning. To that end, we introduced 
a new private caching setting, in which not only the demand information should be kept private, but also the cache information, for a single round of delivery. 

The product of this work unweiled an interesting connection between coded cachinhg and private information retrieval (PIR) settings. The core idea lies in the fact that the cache content of a user 
and the multicast messages in the delivery phase could be resembled as the message of two servers in a two-server PIR scheme. This connection opens the gate between coded caching and PIR which leads
to order-optimal schemes for private caching settings. 

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c linenos %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

You can embed gists the following way:

```html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/fb5e60735c6617f83bc275b7ae86cff7.js"> </script>
```

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fb5e60735c6617f83bc275b7ae86cff7.js"> </script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
