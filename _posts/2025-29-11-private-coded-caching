In this paper, we investigated the private coded caching scenario, where the aim is to preserve the demand privacy for all the users in the system. Specifically, our aim was to extend the 
privacy garauntee to a multi-delivery scenario, in which there are multi rounds of delivery for multi rounds of demand vectors with a single cache phase in the beginning. To that end, we introduced 
a new private caching setting, in which not only the demand information should be kept private, but also the cache information, for a single round of delivery. 

The product of this work unweiled an interesting connection between coded cachinhg and private information retrieval (PIR) settings. The core idea lies in the fact that 
> the cache content of a user and the multicast messages in the delivery phase could be resembled as the message of two servers in a two-server PIR scheme. 

This connection opens the gate between coded caching and PIR which leads to order-optimal schemes for private caching settings.
